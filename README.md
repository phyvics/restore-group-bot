- üîÑ **Automatic Forwarding**: New messages posted in the channel are automatically forwarded to the group
- üì• **Full Restoration**: Restore all existing messages from the channel to the group with a single command
- üîí **Access Control**: Only authorized users can trigger the restoration process
- ‚ö° **Real-time Updates**: Messages are forwarded instantly as they are posted
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and rate limiting to prevent API issues
- üîç **Chat Information**: Get IDs and details of configured channels and groups

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A Telegram Bot Token (get one from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
- A source Telegram Channel (must be a supergroup/channel)
- A target Telegram Group (must be a supergroup)
- Bot must be an admin in both the channel and group with send messages permissions

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phyvics/restore-group-bot.git
   cd restore-group-bot
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the bot:**
   - Copy `config.py` and update the following values:
     - `TOKEN`: Your Telegram Bot Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
     - `CHANNEL_ID`: ID of your source channel (get it using [@myidbot](https://t.me/myidbot))
     - `GROUP_ID`: ID of your target group (get it using [@myidbot](https://t.me/myidbot))
     - `AUTHORIZED_USERS`: List of user IDs who can use the restore command

5. **Set up bot permissions:**
   - Add the bot to your channel as an admin with permission to read messages
   - Add the bot to your group as an admin with permission to send messages
   - The bot only needs send message permissions in the group

## Running the Bot

1. **Start the bot:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Using the bot:**
   - Send `/start` to see the welcome message
   - Send `/help` to see available commands
   - Send `/restore` to start the message restoration process
   - Send `/getids` to view IDs and details of configured channels and groups
   - Send `/cancel` to cancel any ongoing operation

## Commands

- `/start` - Start the bot and see welcome message
- `/help` - Show help message with available commands
- `/restore` - Start the message restoration process
- `/getids` - View IDs and details of configured channels and groups (admin only)
- `/cancel` - Cancel any ongoing operation

## Important Notes

- The bot requires admin privileges in both the source channel and target group
- The restoration process may take some time depending on the number of messages
- Telegram has rate limits, so the bot includes delays between message forwards
- Keep your `config.py` file secure and never commit it to version control
- The bot will automatically forward new messages as they are posted in the channel
- Use `/getids` command to verify channel and group IDs without using external bots
